### Part 1
Just some more examples on [[MAS 3 - Named Game Strategies]] and [[MAS 4 - Nash Equilibrium]].
See notes therein.

### Fictitious Play
A simulation of many games, where each player learns from each other, looking back at the entire history of actions, allowing for the estimation of mixed strategies. In some sense, it is repeated best response. If it converges, it converges to Nash.

In some sense, this deviates from the original rational agents, as they don't know anything from the start, and instead learn from each other as to what to do.

Some Nash equilibria are unreachable with Fictitious Play. In general, it should be said that Fictitious play does not work for mixed strategies.

This appears to be more a model for calculating Nash equilibria than anything else.
