Five group reports:
* Grade: pass / fail (2 fails, 0 points for homework)
* Deadline: Next lab session
* Groups of 4 students
One individual homework:
* Graded, actual coding (4 points).
Final exam: 5 points
* December 19th, 18:30 - not set in stone, there is a clash

"I don't think it is needed for students to know all the proofs or anything. It's not a course in mathematics, you just need to understand the intuition."

Exams are a lot like the assignments, but only a few questions (e.g. 4) They are about your understanding, not your memory.

When I ask about a formula, the formula is given, but no cheat sheet to bring.
