A position from which no one wants to change. It is not optimal, but no one can do better.

This is to say, mutual best response.

Nash proves this equilibrium exists *at least once*. 
* In a pure game, this strategy can be strictly or weakly dominant
* In a mixed game, this strategy is always weak

Weak -> the current response is best *or equal* to the current chosen one
Strong -> the current response is optimal.

For 2-player 0-sum games, the [[MAS 3 - Named Game Strategies]] mini-max and the maxi-min are equal and equivalent to the Nash equilibrium.

Calculating the Nash Equilibrium can be *really* hard.
* For 0-sum games, it can be translated to linear programming, which is the best we can do.

The theorem is proven with fixed-point theorem.
* Sperner's lemma is a relevant proof of this (Trefor Bazzett on youtube), but this is just an aside

Once the amount of players or amount of actions goes to infinity, there might no longer be a Nash equilibrium.
* To be more precise, if there is a continuous space of options, the utility function should be continuous.
