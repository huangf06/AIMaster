(slidedeck 4 - sequential games)

Finding optima when you have perfect information:
-> Reverse induction
-> construct matrix, find all Nash equilibria, then find the one Nash equilibrium that is an equilibrium in all sub-games.

### Sequential games with imperfect information
Imperfect information is drawn with dotted lines between the nodes between which the decider does not know which they are.
-> Games that break up these lines are not valid sub-games, as the individual does not know that there are there.

Sub-game:
* A sub game has to have a singleton as an initial node
* It has all successors
* Any information set is either completely in or completely out.

Generalised (for imperfect information) Backwards induction
* In a state where the sub-game is bigger than usual (because of imperfect information,) this part of the game is turned into a matrix game, as the player does not know what the other does, which is equivalent to a simultaneous game.

The ultimatum game, a model for bargaining, is another example of sequential games.
